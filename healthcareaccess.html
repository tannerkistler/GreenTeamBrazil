    <h1>Access to Healthcare</h1>
    <h2>Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS)</h2>
    <p>Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) was one of the major successes of the Brazilian government regarding universal health care. This system was created to give free healthcare to Brazilian citizens in an effort to reduce healthcare inequality, and the majority of Brazilian citizens rely on this system as a means for receiving treatment. Unfortunately, the SUS still has downfalls. Among the drawbacks includes the wait times and limits to access in rural areas. This results in those with a higher income to purchase private health care plans in an effort to bypass long wait times and other bottlenecks that occur within the system. The SUS was a good effort at combatting accessibility issues, but it’s effects are limited. </p>
    <h2>Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Despite the establishment of the SUS, racial discrimination is often prevalent in Brazilian healthcare. Minorities experience much lower access to health care, resulting in higher mortality rates. Additionally, hospital admission rates prove discrimination among treatment, as white Brazilians often experience higher admissions than any other race. Racial inequality and poverty are often leading factors in access to healthcare, a problematic act that needs to be fixed. </p>
